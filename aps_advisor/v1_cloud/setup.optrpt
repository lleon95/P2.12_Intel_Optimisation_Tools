INLINING OPTION VALUES:
  -inline-factor: 100
  -inline-min-size: 30
  -inline-max-size: 230
  -inline-max-total-size: 2000
  -inline-max-per-routine: 10000
  -inline-max-per-compile: 500000

In the inlining report below:
   "sz" refers to the "size" of the routine. The smaller a routine's size,
      the more likely it is to be inlined.
   "isz" refers to the "inlined size" of the routine. This is the amount
      the calling routine will grow if the called routine is inlined into it.
      The compiler generally limits the amount a routine can grow by having
      routines inlined into it.
